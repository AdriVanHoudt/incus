Incus
===

Incus was created by Imgur.com to be a real-time messaging server that acts as the
intermediary between a web app and a browser.

## How it's used at Imgur
Incus powers Imgur's real-time direct messaging, notifications, as well as
real-time upvotes on all images and comments. It's currently processing over 1,000
events per second per machine, but can actually handle much more than that
(limits have not yet been identifed).
